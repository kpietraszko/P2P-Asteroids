Physics:
- bounce on collision (instead of destroying) if at steep angle? More difficult than expected
- explosions?
- destruction power based on total mass of cluster, so that single particle doesn't kill you? Sounds difficult

If any of colliding is in rotation group 1 or any (but not all!) is bullet => destroy 1 or 2
