Physics:
- explosions?
- destruction power based on total mass of cluster, so that single particle doesn't kill you? Sounds difficult
- schema idea:
 tick number
 1 or 2 bits for each pixel {isFilled}{isGrey?(this bit is only added if isFilled===1)}

- (circular) buffer for snapshots (size somewhere around 3). adds delay but reduces stutter on packet loss
- send input from client - just the shoot position (target)?
- receive input on host and apply to second "turret"; doesn't need tick included; doesn't matter if it's outdated, apply it anyway
- (optional) invite code joining
